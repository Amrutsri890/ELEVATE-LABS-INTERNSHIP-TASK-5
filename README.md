# Network Traffic Capture and Analysis
# Project Summary:
This repository showcases a live network traffic capture and analysis task carried out using Wireshark. The goal was to capture real-time network packets, identify multiple key protocols, and analyze their interactions to gain insights into network behavior and security.

# What’s Included:
•	Packet Capture File (.pcap): Complete raw data of network packets captured during the session.
•	Analysis Report: A detailed report explaining the protocols observed, packet behaviors, and key findings.
•	Screenshots: Visual proof of filtered protocol traffic and packet details highlighted during the analysis.
•	Filter Set: Collection of Wireshark filters used to isolate HTTP, DNS, TCP, and other traffic.

# Key Features:
•	Captures real-world network data on active network interfaces.
•	Applies effective protocol filtering for focused analysis.
•	Examines TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and TLS protocols in-depth.
•	Demonstrates practical skills in network troubleshooting and security monitoring.
•	Provides a clear, organized report with findings and recommendations.

# How to Explore:
•	Open the .pcap file in Wireshark to explore recorded network traffic.
•	Use available filters to concentrate on specific protocols or communications.
•	Review the analysis report for comprehensive insights backed by screenshots.
